## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to gerrymandering and its impact on electoral outcomes. Specifically, I would like to focus on Texas' southernmost congressional districts and observe how gerrymandering in the area has impacted voting patterns. 


## Project Milestone 3

```{r}
install.packages("XQuartz")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
load("F00011657-Latinobarometro_2020_Esp_R_Rdata_v1_0 (2)/Latinobarometro_2020_Eng_Rdata_v1_0.rdata")
Latinobarometro_2020_Eng
View(Latinobarometro_2020_Eng)

# Visualization of Data
Latinobarometro_2020_Eng |> 
       ggplot(mapping = aes(x = edad)) + geom_bar()
```
