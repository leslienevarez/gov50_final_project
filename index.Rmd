# Project Milestone 1

## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to gerrymandering and its impact on electoral outcomes. Specifically, I would like to focus on Texas' southernmost congressional districts and observe how gerrymandering in the area has impacted voting patterns. 

# Project Milestone 2



# Project Milestone 3

```{r, echo=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
Latinobarometro_2020_Eng <- read.csv("data/data.csv")
```
```{r}
# Visualization of Data
Latinobarometro_2020_Eng |> 
       ggplot(mapping = aes(x = edad)) + geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Ages of Respondents in Dataset",
       x = "Age of Respondents",
       y = "Frequency")
```
